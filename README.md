# DOMBars

*This project is under heavy development, please feel free to follow the status of the project. I will be announcing its release when a stable release is available.*

DOMBars is an extension of [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js). It keeps all the same semantics of Handlebars, but aims to generate full DOM objects instead of string-based templates. This is a powerful concept when you consider data binding, dynamic injection and reactive programming. By creating a DOM representation of the template, we can simply keep track of nodes in the DOM and update the node when data changes without any obtrusive or special markup in the template or output.
